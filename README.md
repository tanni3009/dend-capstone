# DEND Capstone project
Capstone project for the Udacity Data Engineering Nanodegree

Author: Tanja HÃ¶sl <br/>

## Scoping the project and gathering data

During the course of this capstone project, an open dataset should be analysed.
Since the EU offers open data published by EU institutions and bodies via their **European Union Open Data Portal** (https://data.europa.eu/euodp/en/home), this data source was browsed to find a dataset suitable for this project.
The datasets were assessed following two criteria: 1 - proving an analytics use case of personal interest to the creator of this project and 2 - fulfilling the dataset criteria for this assessment of at least two different data sources in two different format and at least one million source rows.

### The source dataset - Erasmus mobility statistics
The chosen dataset provides mobility statistics about the Erasmus programme, an EU programme to support education, training, youth and sport in Europe. This programme aims to provide millions of Europeans opportunities to study, train and gain experience abroad.

The European Union Open Data Portal provides Erasmus mobility statistics datasets for various years. For the scope of this project I chose to use datasets for 5 years:
1. 2008-09: https://data.europa.eu/euodp/en/data/dataset/erasmus-mobility-statistics-2008-09
1. 2009-10: https://data.europa.eu/euodp/en/data/dataset/erasmus-facts-figures-trends-2009-2010
1. 2010-11: https://data.europa.eu/euodp/en/data/dataset/erasmus-facts-figures-trends-2010-2011
1. 2011-12: https://data.europa.eu/euodp/en/data/dataset/erasmus-facts-figures-trends-2010-2011
1. 2012-13: https://data.europa.eu/euodp/en/data/dataset/erasmus-mobility-statistics-2012-13

Altogether, these sources contain data for over 1 million study exchanges and work placements in CSV format.

As a second datasource, a list of participating institutions is available in JSON format.

### Scope of the capstone project 
The end goal of this project is to provide analytics table in a star schema, to be able to analyse Erasmus mobility behaviour during 2008 to 2012. The tables should be able to answer analytics questions including
* How many students took the opportunity for a study exchange or work placement each (academic) year?
* What are the most popular countries to go to for studying abroad?
* What are the most popular institutions to go to?
* How long do students stay abroad?

The scope for the different steps will be defined as follows:
1. **Explore and Assess the Data**

    The outcome of this step should be a unified CSV file for the five years of Erasmus mobility data. As the CSV formats for the different years are not all aligned, this step is important for pre-processing the data to be able to smoothly run ETL on it later on.
    
    Moreover, the data exploration will give me an idea of which attributes can actually be used to answer the questions defined above and will serve as input for the data modelling afterwards. A provided data catalog on the data portal will help with that.
    
    
1. **Define the Data Model**

    After having assessed the data, the next step is to conceptualize the data model and explaining will the resulting model will serve the above mentioned analytics use cases.
    Additionally, an outline for the data pipeline will be given.
    
1. **Run ETL to Model the Data**
    
    The defined concept will be implemented in this step to provide the analytics table in a Postgres database.

## Exploring and assessing the data
Documentation of the steps to exploring the data, identifying data quality issues and cleaning them up can be found in *01_data_cleaning.ipynb*.

The resulting CSV file for student mobility data was split into several smaller files for two reasons:
1. to be able to upload it to GitHub (file size limit of 100MB)
1. to transform the data file by file in the ETL pipeline later on

## Defining the data model

### Conceptual model

The explored and assessed data will be transformed into facts and dimensions as follows.

#### FactStudentMobility
| Column name | Description | Type | Constraints |
|---|---|---|---|
| home_institution_code | code for student's home institution | TEXT | NOT NULL |
| host_institution_code | code for student's host institution | TEXT |  |

| student_years_prior | number of study years prior to period abroad | SMALLINT |  |
| student_previous_participation | indicates whether student received prior Erasmus grant | CHAR(1) |  |
| work_placement | name of organisation for work placement | TEXT |  |
| work_placement_country | country of organisation for work placement | CHAR(2) | ISO2 country code |
| length_study | length of study period in months | DECIMAL(4,2) |  |
| length_work | length of work placement in months | DECIMAL(4,2) |  |
| short_duration_reason | reason for participation less than 3 months | CHAR(1) |  |
| study_start_date | start date of study period | CHAR(7) | format: yyyy-mm |
| work_start_date | start date of placement period | CHAR(7) | format: yyyy-mm |
| combined_start_date | start date of period abroad | CHAR(7) | calculated as MIN(study_start_date, work_start_date)|
| ects_study | anticipated credits for study | SMALLINT |  |
| ects_work | anticipated credits for placement | SMALLINT |  |
| ects_total | total anticipated credits | SMALLINT | calculated as SUM(ects_study, ects_work) |

| work_grant | grant awarded for work placement | DECIMAL(8,2) |  |
| total_grant | total grant awarded | DECIMAL(8,2) | calculated as SUM(sn_supplement, study_grant, work_grant) |

#### DimInstitution
| Column name | Description | Type | Constraints |
|---|---|---|---|
| institution_code | code for institution | TEXT | PK |
| application_reference_number | reference number for applications | TEXT | NOT NULL |
| organisation_name | name of institution | TEXT |  |
| country | country of institution | CHAR(2) | ISO2 country code |
| city | city of institution | TEXT |  |

#### DimDate
| Column name | Description | Type | Constraints |
|---|---|---|---|
| year_month_code | unique code for month/year | CHAR(7) | PK, format: yyyy-mm |
| month_number | number of month | SMALLINT | NOT NULL, [1-12] |
| month_name | name of month | TEXT | NOT NULL |
| year_number | number of year | SMALLINT | NOT NULL  |
| academic_year | string representing academic year | CHAR(7)  | NOT NULL, e.g. 2008-09 |

The central table in this dimensional schema is the fact table **FactStudentMobility** that contains transactional data whereby one transaction represents a student going abroad.
This table contains facts like the length of the study period, grant awarded for the time abroad or ECTS credits the students anticipated.

To be able to slice and dice the data for analytics, the host institution as well as the date for the start of the abroad period have been modelled as dimensions.
This enables us to answer questions like which countries are the most popular to go to or analyse trends over time.


### Pipelining the data into the dimensional model

#### Loading dimensions
##### DimInstitution
The data for institutions is available as a separate dataset, so this dimension can be easily filled from the provided JSON file.
This data was already cleaned in the previous step so no transformations are needed any more and the data can be directly loaded in the dimension table.

##### DimDate
The data for this dimension will be calculated. As the exact timeframe for the data to be analysed is known, this dimension table will be filled for the years 2008 to 2013.
The table will represent one month per row whereas the columns will be calculated based on the month of interest.
The academic_year field will be calculated based on the rule that the academic years starts in September and ends in August.


#### Loading the fact table
The fact table will be filled from the student data. Some columns need to be transformed to another format but most of the data has also already been cleaned in the previous step.
Some columns will be calculated based on other columns to be able to unify querying of different study exchange programme types.
